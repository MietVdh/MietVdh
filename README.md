### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Miet (pronounced /mit/ - sort of like 'meet'), and I am originally from Belgium, now living in Canada. I have a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics, and did some freelance translation work while my children were little. Once they needed a little less mommy time, I started Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. I found that I really enjoyed it, and decided to go back to school to get a Computer Programming diploma.

Now I'm looking to get my first job in tech, while continuing to improve my skills. I'm currently focusing on NodeJS.
